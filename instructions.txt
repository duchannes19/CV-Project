Create a conda env with python 3.9 and install the following packages:

For conda install CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1 with conda-forge (also on the OS I think).

For pip:

pip install tensorflow==2.10.0
pip install keras==2.10.0
pip install "numpy<2.0"
pip install cmake
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install opencv-python
pip install dlib==19.24.0
pip install mediapipe==0.10.0
pip install fastapi==0.70.0
pip install uvicorn==0.15.0
pip install plotly
pip install scikit-plot


To run the backend also install the requirements and then:
waitress-serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000 app:app

Hope that it works.
